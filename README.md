CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION

An end-to-end machine learning application for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using multiple classification models.
The project features a fully interactive Streamlit dashboard where users can upload data, select a model (Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression), and visualize predictions with fraud probability scores.

OBJECTIVE: 

Detect fraudulent transactions from an anonymized credit card dataset and deliver a user-friendly dashboard to:

- Improve fraud recall without significantly harming precision
- Allow users to upload and evaluate their own datasets
- Offer transparency and model choice via performance insights
- Enable download of flagged transactions for action
